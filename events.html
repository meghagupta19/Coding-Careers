                        <h2>Web Development</h2>
                        <p>
                            Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing markup.

                            <h3>What is the Priority of a Web Developer?</h3>
                            <p>
                                To answer the question “What is a web developer?”, we must first look at what a web developer does and how they do it.A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website. They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. 
                            Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.
                             As you can imagine, this can take a lot of time and effort and requires an intricate understanding of various programming languages and how they are used. Different types of developers specialize in different areas, which means that large web projects are usually a collaboration between several different developers.
                            </p>
                            <h3>How To Be A Web Developer</h3>
                            <p>
                                Now that we have started to answer the question of “What is a web developer?”, it’s time to start looking at how to be a web developer. While a lot of people do their research, decide on programming languages to learn, and have a good go at learning web development, the majority of them fail due to a distinct lack of direction.
                               If you are serious about building a career for yourself as an experienced web developer, then you need to make sure that you start with a clear vision of how you are going to achieve this.

                                Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available 
                                for learning increases. Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning.

                        In this Arduino tutorial, you will learn what is Arduino? Why should you choose Arduino? What can you do with Arduino? And what’s on the Arduino board? So let’s get started.
                        <h4>What is Arduino?</h4>
                          <p>
                            Arduino is an open source platform that is used to program hardware using software. Arduino boards consists of a micro-controller and other electronic components that can be programmed using Arduino programming language to do different tasks. It doesn’t require a separate hardware to upload the code in it. The code can be upload by just using a USB cable. The code will be saved on the Arduino and will run until you will upload a new code.
                          </p>

                              <li>It is an open source project and you can easily customize and extend it by using sensors and modules. The software is also free to download.</li>
                              <li>It is cross platform and can run on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.</li>
                              <li>It is inexpensive and the most commonly used Arduino board (Arduino Uno) costs less than $10.</li>
                              <li>It is very easy to use, you just need to connect it to computer via USB cable and it will automatically install the drivers and will be ready to use.</li>
                              <li>It has large support community and you can find extensive number of libraries and shields.</li>

                <p>
                    UX and UI refer to the processes that construct the development of a design. In website design, user experience and user interface work hand-in-hand to create a beautiful and functioning website.

                   <h3>What is UI & UX Design?</h3>
                   <p>
                    Design is a broad stream of subjects and isn’t limited to graphic design. When someone says “I’m a designer’, it is not immediately clear what they actually do day to day. There are a numerous pillars of responsibility which together holds design upright. Design related roles exist in a range of domains viz, graphic design, textile design, interior design, fashion design, ceramic design, print design and more. With the relatively recent influx of tech companies focused on creating interfaces for screens, many new design roles have emerged.
                    Job titles like UX Developer or UI designer have emerged as the future front of design roles. Its meaning is unfamiliar even to designers who come from other industries.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Seperating UI UX</h3>
                      <p>
                        UX design refers to user experience design, while UI design stands for user interface design. Both of these are crucial to an IT product and need to work closely together.
                        <br> Despite being very integral to each other, the roles themselves are quite different, involving distinct processes.
                        <h4>UX is User Experience</h4>
                        <p>UX design is a still a relatively new field, with many companies only just waking up to the fact that they need someone on their payroll if they want to succeed in attracting and retaining customers.
                            <br> Part of the confusion might lie in the name: UX design. For many people, the word “design” is associated with creativity, colors and graphics, when really its true definition lies in functionality, as well as the process behind making products that provide a seamless experience for the people who use them.

                            We all know that a plane can be flown from its cockpit. The UX to fly it is there, but the controls are arranged in such a way that it’s not intuitive — it has a complicated UI. Creating a great UI is a challenge, especially because it has to be intuitive.<br>When asked in a research if people like Samsung phones or Apple phones, most people said that they like Apple. Even though both the brands have the same experience of a phone as a product, people largely preferred one over the other, why?<br>To the question why they like Apple phones better, the response was consistent and immediate: “I find the Apple phone much more intuitive.”<br><br>
