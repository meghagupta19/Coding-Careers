                        <h2>Web Development</h2>
                        <p>
                            Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per 
                            the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with 
                            the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing markup.

                            <h3>What is the Priority of a Web Developer?</h3>
                            <p>
                                To answer the question “What is a web developer?”, we must first look at what a web developer does and how they do it.
                            
                            A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website. They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. 
                            Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.
                            
                            As you can imagine, this can take a lot of time and effort and requires an intricate understanding 
                            of various programming languages and how they are used. Different types of developers specialize in different areas, which means that large web projects are usually a collaboration between several different developers.
                            </p>
                            <h3>How To Be A Web Developer</h3>
                            <p>
                                Now that we have started to answer the question of “What is a web developer?”, it’s time to start looking at how to be a web developer. While a lot of people do their research, decide on programming languages to learn, and have a good go at learning web development, the majority of them fail due to a distinct lack of direction.
    
    If you are serious about building a career for yourself as an experienced web developer, then you need to make sure that you start with a clear vision of how you are going to achieve this.

                                Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes
                                 naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational

                                  The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available 
                                for learning increases. Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning.

                        Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino 
                        consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller)

                       <p>
                        In this Arduino tutorial, you will learn what is Arduino? Why should you choose Arduino? 
                        What can you do with Arduino? And what’s on the Arduino board? So let’s get started.
                        <h4>What is Arduino?</h4>
                          <p>
                            Arduino is an open source platform that is used to program hardware using software. Arduino boards consists of a micro-controller and other electronic components that can be programmed using Arduino programming language to do different tasks.
                            It doesn’t require a separate hardware to upload the code in it. The code can be upload by just using a USB cable. The code will be saved on the Arduino and will run until you will upload a new code.
    
                          </p> 
                          <h4>Why should you Choose Arduino?</h4>
                          <ul>
                              <li>It is an open source project and you can easily customize and extend it by using sensors and modules. The software is also free to download.</li>
                              <li>It is cross platform and can run on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.
                            </li>
                              <li>It is inexpensive and the most commonly used Arduino board (Arduino Uno) costs less than $10.
                            </li>
                              <li>It is very easy to use, you just need to connect it to computer via USB cable and it will automatically install the drivers and will be ready to use.
                            </li>
                              <li>It has large support community and you can find extensive number of libraries and shields.
